Cauliflower Tacos – roasted Cauliflower and Chickpeas with Lime Crema – make tonight a taco night because these healthy tacos are easy to make and SO good! 


Toss the chickpeas and cauliflower in spice mixture I created that included:
chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. I also added fresh lime juice and a little olive oil.
Roast them until the chickpeas were crunchy and the cauliflower florets are tender. I could have snacked on the chickpeas and cauliflower straight from the pan, they were so flavorful. I stopped myself 
because I had tacos to make!
I used small corn tortillas to make my tacos. You can use a larger size if you want, I just love mini tacos…so I can eat more:)
Top warm corn tortillas with roasted chickpeas and cauliflower.
Add chopped red cabbage, jalapeño slices, avocado, cilantro, and lime crema.
